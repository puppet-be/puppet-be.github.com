Jan did gave a presentaion @ puppetcamp Ghent : http://vstone.eu/talks/puppet-module-testing

More details will be published when available.

Before coming to the workshop, make sure you have ruby, rubygems and bundler installed.

Also, I don't wanna be an ass, but I've been using ruby 1.9 lately... Maybe we'll have to work-around some ruby 1.8 issues while we go through it.

Short Agenda:

* Vagrant (skipping through) 
* Testing (Setup) 
** ruby/bundler stuffs 
** rake tralala 
* Tools 
** rspec-puppet 
** puppetlabs_spec_helper 
** hiera puppet testing (?) 
** rspec-augeas 
* Extra 
** travis-ci
