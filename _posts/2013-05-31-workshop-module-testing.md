Before coming to the workshop, make sure you have ruby, rubygems and bundler installed.

Also, I don't wanna be an ass, but I've been using ruby 1.9 lately... Maybe we'll have to work-around some ruby 1.8 issues while we go through it.

Short Agenda:

* Vagrant (skipping through)
* Testing (Setup)
  * ruby/bundler stuffs
  * rake tralala
* Tools
  * rspec-puppet
  * puppetlabs_spec_helper
  * hiera puppet testing (?)
  * rspec-augeas
* Extra
  * travis-ci
