I would like to thank everyone attending the kickoff meeting.

It was very constructive. We already have a lot of topics and the first workshop will be on may 31. I would like to thank the organizers of Loadays, for providing the time and place for this meetup. Special thanks go to Dawn Foster for attending the meeting, and to Kris, for his splendid idea to held our kickoff @ loadays.

Johan
